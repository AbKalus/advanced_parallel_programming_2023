Python project

The purpose of this project is to extend the code produced during the eleventh exercise (19 December 2023) allowing to support the following features:
	- Comparison operators
	- Definition of variables
	- Sequences
	- Conditionals and iterations
	- Subroutines
	- Additional features
Before implementing the additional features, the initial file was broken down to simplify the structure and make work easier.
The final structure of the project is as follows:

.
├── README.txt
└── modules
    ├── additional_exception.py
    ├── all_import.py
    ├── arithmetic_op.py
    ├── comparison_op.py
    ├── condition_loop.py
    ├── expression.py
    ├── extra_op.py
    ├── operation.py
    ├── sequence.py
    ├── stack.py
    ├── subroutine.py
    └── variable_definition.py

The modules are divided by type of operations, i.e. the division present in the project delivery was used.

To use all the modules import from the modules folder all_import.py as follows " from modules.all_import import * "
